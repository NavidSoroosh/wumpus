# Wumpus World â€” AI with Conditional Independence

This project implements the classic **Wumpus World** problem in Python, with an AI agent that uses **conditional independence** for probabilistic reasoning in a partially observable and uncertain environment.

## Project Goals

- Simulate the Wumpus World environment (agent, pits, gold, Wumpus)
- Apply conditional independence to infer hidden dangers
- Develop an AI that safely explores and reaches the goal

## Features

- Knowledge representation based on percepts (stench, breeze, etc.)
- Probabilistic reasoning using conditional independence
- Intelligent decision-making: safe exploration and risk assessment
- Optional implementation using Bayesian networks
